DATA ARE SECERT!

1. Explanation of files:
(1). Extreme weather prediction (typhoon): Predictive model using when extreme weather. We recommend use this model during extreme weather days;
(2). Long_time prediction (Gamma optimized by hand): Predictive model using for normal days. Hyper parameters are shape and scale parameters in Gamma distribution. We optimize these parameters by experience (Easy but inefficient);
(3). Long_time prediction (Gamma optimized by SAA): Predictive model using for normal days, but hyper parameters can be optimized by Simulated Annealing Algorithm (Difficult but Auto-optimization).

We built predictive logistic regression model based on two features: "History flow" and "History sea level".
"History" is the most innovative part in this project.
