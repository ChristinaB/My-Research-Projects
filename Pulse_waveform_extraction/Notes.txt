The Video was processed by motion magnification (Phase-Based Video Motion Processing http://people.csail.mit.edu/nwadhwa/phase-video/ )

We track the motion of pulse at the hand by optical flow and removed global motion by setting reference points that are not at the ROI.

Finally, the signal output processed by FIR filter.
